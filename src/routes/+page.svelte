      I recently left a job at <a class="link" href="https://modal.com">Modal</a
      >, a new cloud computing platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope to develop better <em>interactive software</em> for people to cultivate
      and share ideas, and to meaningfully express what brings them joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Towards that goal, I am a generalist and care deeply about <em>systems</em
      >, which form the fundamental building blocks of our applications; and
      <em>interaction design</em>, how we use and live with computers that are
      all around us.

        I am a student at Harvard University studying mathematics and computer
        science, as well as a
        <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/ekzhang"

        I enjoy programming and am often working on
        <a href="/projects">projects</a>. My recent work has been on
        <strong>semantic segmentation</strong> at Nvidia, and a
        <strong>logic programming</strong> engine inspired by research at
        Harvard's programming languages group. Currently, I'm working on a
        physically-based path tracer, generative music models based on Langevin
        dynamics, and taint analysis for web fingerprinting. I'm also thinking
        about how to design
        <a href="https://github.com/ekzhang/warp-react-template/"
          >robust web applications</a
        >.

        My academic interests are in algorithms, machine learning, and
        programming languages. I was a teaching fellow for
        <em>CS 124 (Data Structures and Algorithms)</em> in Spring 2020, taught
        by Michael Mitzenmacher. This semester, I am a teaching fellow for
        <em>CS 182 (Artificial Intelligence)</em>, taught by Milind Tambe and
        Boaz Barak.

        I wrote a physics book for high school students with Branislav
        Kisačanin, which was recently published by AIP. The free PDF version is
        available online

      <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
      <p>
        In high school, I won two gold medals representing the US at the
        International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), placing 7<sup>th</sup>
        globally. I also ranked highly in the national math and physics
        olympiads, and I compete on Harvard's ICPC team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have written and tested problems for major national and international
        programming competitions, including the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://usaco.org/">USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, I maintain an advanced algorithm and data structure library
        available
        <a href="https://ekzlib.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. If you are looking for
        tutoring, I've previously taught recorded courses with
        <a href="https://alphastar.academy/courses/cs-courses/"
          >Alphastar&nbsp;Academy</a
        >
        for motivated students aiming to perform at a high level in programming
        competitions.
